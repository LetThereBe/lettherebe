Developing your project
=======================

``LetThereBe`` will set up your project with some basic tests and documentation and link it to the tools needed to run and build these for you, however as your project grows you will need to develop these further. On this page we provide links to some guides to help you do this.

Testing
-------

- `Testing Your Code <http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing/tests/>`_ from *The Hitchiker's Guide to Python*: general guidance on writing tests and ``python``-specific examples
- `Automated testing <https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex47.html>`_ from *Learn Python the Hard Way*
- `pytest framework documentation <http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for testing ``python`` code


Documentation
-------------

- `A beginner's guide to writing documentation <http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/>`_ from Write The Docs
- `ReadTheDocs documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_
- `Quick reStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_: guide on rst (reStructured Text) syntax. This is the default markup language used by sphinx for documentation.
