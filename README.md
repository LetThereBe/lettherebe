## What is LetThereBe?

LetThereBe automates the creation of a software project for collaborative development across any discipline to support best practice. It lowers the barrier for good practice development by providing an extension to GitHub (or equivalent) to generate an immediately usable project structure automatically.

A common problem that researchers face is how to start a collaborative software project, delivering software which meets best practices often requires many different tools and systems to be configured. A versioning service, CI server, unit tests etc. With the barrier to entry being raised by this complexity, developers may forget aspects or decide to do it later, often resulting in these best practices being implemented too late, or even not being implemented at all.

When setting up your project, LetThereBe will ask simple questions (e.g. software language, license, etc.) and will then create a skeleton for the new project which will incite the use of best practice in software development. It will create a proper structure including source code directory, documentation template (prerequisites, build/install instructions, etc.), skeletal test structure, necessary files needed (AUTHOR, CONTRIBUTING, CITATION, requirements, etc.) and also configure automatically some continuous integration configuration files, for example for Travis CI.
